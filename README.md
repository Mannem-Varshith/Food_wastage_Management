**Zero-Waste - AI Powered Geo-Intelligent Food Donation & Rescue System**

Project Title: Zero-Waste

Domain: Web Development

Problem Statement: Food wastage remains a major global issue, with surplus food from households, restaurants, and caterers often going unused due to the absence of an efficient distribution mechanism. At the same time, many NGOs, shelters, and individuals face food insecurity. The challenge lies in bridging this gap through a reliable, real-time system that can intelligently match excess food with verified recipients.

Problem Description: Current systems lack automation, live tracking, and scalability—leading to delays, spoilage, and lost opportunities to serve those in need. Zero-Waste is designed to tackle these issues by providing a scalable, intelligent platform that connects food donors (households, restaurants, caterers, and canteens) with verified recipients (NGOs, shelters, and individuals in need) using real-time geolocation, AI-driven insights, and automated logistics management.

Project Explanation: Zero-Waste is an AI-powered, geo-intelligent food donation and rescue platform designed to tackle food wastage and hunger. The platform bridges the gap between food donors and recipients using modern technologies: Real-time GPS Tracking: The platform tracks the location of food donations and recipients in real-time. AI-driven Food Estimation: Uses AI to estimate food quantity based on images, reducing manual input errors. Interactive Mapping: Recipients can view available food donations on a Google Maps-powered dashboard. Automated Logistics Management: Facilitates the pickup and delivery of donated food using automated logistics solutions. Key Features: Donor Registration: Donors (households, restaurants, caterers) can register via email or OAuth. Food Posting: Donors post food availability including type (veg/non-veg, perishable/non-perishable), quantity, expiry time, and location. Recipient Registration & Verification: Recipients (NGOs, shelters, individuals) can register and undergo a verification process. Real-time GeoMap Dashboard: A live map view for recipients to find food by proximity, freshness, and type. Donation Lifecycle: Donations go through various stages: Pending → Accepted → Picked → Verified. Food Filtering: Recipients can filter donations by proximity, food type, and freshness. Automated Routing for Volunteers: Integration with routing APIs to guide volunteers or logistics teams for efficient pickup. Admin Panel: Platform moderation, analytics (food saved, people served, CO₂ emissions prevented), user management, and system integrity enforcement. Impact Analytics: Provides real-time data on food saved, emissions prevented, and people served.

How it Works: Donors Post Food: Donors submit available food with essential details (quantity, type, location). Recipients View Donations: Verified recipients can view available food on an interactive map, filter by distance, type, and freshness, and request a pickup. Automated Logistics: Volunteers or logistics teams are automatically directed to the pickup location for the donation. Tracking and Impact Measurement: The system tracks food donations and their impact on food wastage and hunger relief.

Features for Admin: User and Food Post Moderation: Admin can approve, reject, or flag suspicious activity. Analytics: Track food saved, people served, and CO₂ emissions prevented. Verification: Onboarding verified NGOs and volunteers. Fraud Detection: Flagging of fraudulent users or expired posts.
